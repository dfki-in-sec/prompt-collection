# Prompt Collection for Cyber Deception
Welcome to the Prompt Collections Repository! This repository is created to collect prompts for [our paper](https://github.com/redacted). Gathering user feedback is crucial for improving our research, and your input is invaluable in this process.

# Purpose
The primary purpose of this repository is to provide a centralized location for submitting, discussing, and organizing prompts for some defined categories that can be used to create Honeytoken. By collecting a wide range of prompts from various users, we aim to study varied ways of conversing with Large Language Models (LLMs) like Bard, ChatGPT, LLaMA etc. on how they respond to such prompts.

# How to Contribute
Contributing to this repository is easy! If you have a better prompt structure for any category(ies) that you believe should be included in our user survey, please follow these steps:

1. Check Existing Prompts: Before submitting a new prompt, please check if a similar question prompt already exists in the repository.
2. Submit a New Prompt:
    * Click on the "**Issues**" tab above.
    * Click on the green "**New Issue**" button.
    * Provide a clear and concise title for your prompt.
    * In the description, explain for which sub-category of Honeytoken the prompt is being used.
    * Label your issue with appropriate tags (e.g., "Feature Request", "Bug Report", "Feedback", etc.).
    * Click "**Submit new issue**" to create your prompt.
3. Discuss Existing Prompts: Feel free to participate in discussions on existing prompts. Your insights and perspectives can help refine and improve the wording or relevance of the prompts.
